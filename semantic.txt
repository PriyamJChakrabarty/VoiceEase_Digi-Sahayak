2. Sentiment-Adaptive "Empathy Engine"
The Concept: Customer support isn't just about logic; it's about emotion. If a user yells "This useless network is down again!", a standard AI saying "Please provide your plan ID" sounds robotic and rude. Your AI should detect the Anger, apologize first, and switch to a calmer, more reassuring tone.

JSON

{
  "sentiment": "angry",
  "response_text": "I am truly sorry for the trouble, Sir. Let me fix this immediately..."
}
If sentiment == "angry", your code can prefix the TTS output with a soothing preamble or even slightly slow down the speech rate (if gTTS permits, or just add pauses ...).

3. "Predictive" Smart Recharges (Data-Driven Personalization)
The Concept: Instead of asking "What plan do you want?", the AI proactively looks at the transactions table and says: "Sir, your data usually runs out on the 25th. You typically buy the ₹499 plan. Should I repeat that?"
