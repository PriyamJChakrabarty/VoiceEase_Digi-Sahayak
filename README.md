# VoiceEase Digi-Sahayak

An intelligent Hinglish-speaking voice assistant that makes telecom services simple, accessible, and human-like — no more confusing IVRs or endless menus.

🌐 **Now available with Web Interface!** Choose between CLI or beautiful Streamlit web UI.





📌 Problem Statement

Telecom companies in India serve hundreds of millions of users, many of whom:

Face difficulty navigating complex IVR menus.

Struggle with digital apps due to limited literacy or smartphone knowledge.

Prefer speaking in Hinglish (natural Hindi-English mix).

Need instant answers about mobile recharges, data balance, validity, or network issues.

Current systems — SMS notifications, mobile apps, or call center IVRs — often create confusion, frustration, and delays, leading to poor customer satisfaction and high operational costs.

💡 Solution Overview

This project implements an Agentic AI Call Agent that acts as a telecom helpline representative, but in a friendly Hinglish voice conversation. It provides users with direct, spoken answers about their telecom needs without navigating endless menus.

Key Features

Natural Hinglish Conversation – Customers can ask:

"Mera data balance kitna bacha hai?"

"Best recharge plan under 300 rupees kya hai?"

"Mera number kab tak valid hai?"

Voice-Based Interaction – Listens to queries and replies in spoken Hinglish, removing text barriers.

Preloaded Telecom Knowledge – Handles FAQs like recharge packs, balance check, SIM validity, complaint status.

Respectful & Clear Tone – Uses polite Hinglish (“aap”, “sir/madam”) to sound like a professional telecom agent.

Fallback Support – If query is too complex, politely directs the customer to a human agent or service center.

🎯 Business Logic

User calls the AI agent → Asks queries in Hinglish.

Agent listens & extracts intent → Identifies topic: recharge, balance, validity, complaints, etc.

Knowledge Lookup → Finds structured telecom info (plans, balances, offers).

Response Generated in Hinglish → Example:

"Ji madam, aapke number ka data balance 1.2 GB hai aur validity 3 din tak hai."

"Best recharge ₹249 hai, jo 1.5 GB/day aur unlimited calls deta hai, 28 din ke liye."

Agent speaks the reply → No need to press keys or read SMS.

📊 Why This Matters for Telecoms

Better Customer Experience → Removes IVR pain, offers instant answers.

Accessibility → Works for people with limited literacy or app access.

Reduced Call Center Load → Automates common queries like data balance, recharge packs.

Stronger Customer Loyalty → Conversational Hinglish feels familiar and trustworthy.

24/7 Service → Always available, unlike human agents.
